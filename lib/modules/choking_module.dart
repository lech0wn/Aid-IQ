# MODULE OVERVIEW

This module provides essential knowledge and skills for recognizing and managing choking emergencies. Choking occurs when an object blocks the airway, preventing normal breathing. Quick and appropriate action can save a life. This module covers both partial and complete airway obstruction and teaches the proper techniques for back blows and abdominal thrusts (Heimlich maneuver).

# LEARNING OUTCOMES

By the end of this module, learners will be able to:

- Differentiate between partial and complete airway obstruction.
- Describe appropriate interventions for partial obstruction.
- Demonstrate proper technique for back blows.
- Demonstrate proper technique for abdominal thrusts (Heimlich maneuver).
- Understand when to alternate between back blows and abdominal thrusts.
- Recognize when emergency medical help is needed.

## LESSON 1: UNDERSTANDING CHOKING

### What is Choking?

Choking occurs when a foreign object becomes lodged in the throat or windpipe, blocking the flow of air to the lungs.

**Common Causes:**

- Food (especially meat, hot dogs, hard candy, nuts)
- Small objects (toys, coins, buttons)
- Eating too quickly
- Not chewing food properly
- Talking or laughing while eating

### Universal Sign of Choking

A person who is choking will often:

- Clutch their throat with one or both hands (universal choking sign)
- Have a panicked or distressed expression
- Be unable to speak or make sounds
- Turn blue or pale

**Remember**: If someone is clutching their throat, ask "Are you choking?" If they nod but cannot speak, immediate action is needed.

## LESSON 2: TYPES OF AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION

### Partial Obstruction (Mild Choking)

**Signs and Symptoms:**

- The patient can usually speak
- The patient can cry (in children)
- The patient can cough
- The patient can breathe (though may be wheezing or struggling)
- Air is still getting through, though not fully

**Key Point**: The patient may be able to clear the blockage themselves through coughing.

### Complete Obstruction (Severe Choking)

**Signs and Symptoms:**

- The patient cannot speak
- The patient cannot cough effectively
- The patient cannot breathe
- May make high-pitched sounds or no sound at all
- Skin may turn blue (cyanosis), especially around lips and face
- May clutch throat with hands
- Will eventually become unconscious without help

**Key Point**: This is a life-threatening emergency requiring immediate intervention.

## LESSON 3: MANAGING PARTIAL OBSTRUCTION

### Step 1: Encourage Coughing

**What to do:**

- Stay calm and reassure the person
- Encourage them to keep coughing to clear the blockage
- Coughing is the body's natural and most effective way to clear an obstruction

**Why it works:**

- Coughing creates strong airflow that can dislodge the object
- It's safer than manual intervention when the person can still breathe

### Step 2: Ask Them to Spit Out the Object

**What to do:**

- If the object is visible in their mouth, ask them to spit it out
- Stay with them and monitor their condition

**Important**: Do NOT put your fingers in their mouth to help them, as they may bite you accidentally during distress or panic.

### Step 3: Monitor Closely

**What to watch for:**

- If coughing becomes weak or stops
- If breathing becomes more difficult
- If the person cannot speak anymore
- If the person starts to turn blue

**Action**: If the partial obstruction becomes a complete obstruction, immediately begin back blows.

### Step 4: Start Back Blows if Coughing Does Not Work

If the person continues to choke and coughing is not effective, proceed to back blows (see Lesson 4).

## LESSON 4: MANAGING COMPLETE OBSTRUCTION - BACK BLOWS

### When to Use Back Blows

Use back blows when:

- The person cannot speak, cough, or breathe
- Coughing is not effective in clearing the blockage
- The obstruction is complete

### How to Perform Back Blows

**Step 1: Position Yourself**

- Stand behind the person and slightly to one side
- For a child, you may need to kneel

**Step 2: Support Their Chest**

- Place one hand on their chest for support
- This prevents them from falling forward

**Step 3: Lean Them Forward**

- Lean the person forward so their upper body is bent at the waist

**Why**: This position allows gravity to help—the object blocking the airway will come out of their mouth rather than moving further down

**Step 4: Deliver Back Blows**

- Use the heel of your other hand
- Give up to 5 sharp blows between the shoulder blades
- Each blow should be firm and delivered with force
- Aim for the area between the shoulder blades

**Step 5: Check the Mouth**

- After each blow, quickly check the casualty's mouth
- If you see the object, ask them to spit it out
- Remove anything that may be lodged there (only if clearly visible and easy to remove)
- Do NOT perform a blind finger sweep

### Important Safety Notes

- Each back blow should be separate and distinct, not continuous patting
- Use enough force to dislodge the object
- Check between blows to see if the object has been expelled

## LESSON 5: MANAGING COMPLETE OBSTRUCTION - ABDOMINAL THRUSTS

### When to Use Abdominal Thrusts

Use abdominal thrusts (also known as the Heimlich maneuver) if:

- The casualty is still choking after 5 back blows
- Back blows have not dislodged the object

### How to Perform Abdominal Thrusts (Heimlich Maneuver)

**Step 1: Position Yourself**

- Stand behind the person
- Wrap your arms around their waist
- Position yourself so you can deliver thrusts effectively

**Step 2: Make a Fist**

- Make a fist with one hand
- Place it slightly above the person's navel (belly button)
- Position it below the ribcage

**Step 3: Grasp Your Fist**

- Place your other hand over your fist
- Hold firmly

**Step 4: Deliver Abdominal Thrusts**

- Pull inward and upward with a quick, forceful motion
- The movement should be like a "J" shape—inward and upward
- Give up to 5 abdominal thrusts
- Each thrust should be separate and distinct

**Step 5: Check the Mouth**

- After the thrusts, quickly check the casualty's mouth
- Remove any dislodged pieces if visible and easy to remove
- Check if the person can breathe

### Important Safety Considerations

**Do NOT perform abdominal thrusts on:**

- Infants under 1 year old (use back blows and chest thrusts instead)
- Pregnant women (use chest thrusts instead)
- Very obese individuals where you cannot wrap your arms around (use chest thrusts instead)

**Caution:**

- Abdominal thrusts can cause internal injuries
- Anyone who receives abdominal thrusts should be examined by a doctor afterward, even if the object is dislodged

## LESSON 6: ALTERNATING BETWEEN BACK BLOWS AND ABDOMINAL THRUSTS

### The Cycle

If the blockage is not cleared after the first round:

Repeat the following cycle:

- 5 back blows → Check mouth
- 5 abdominal thrusts → Check mouth
- 5 back blows → Check mouth
- 5 abdominal thrusts → Check mouth

Continue alternating between 5 back blows and 5 abdominal thrusts until:

- The blockage is dislodged
- The object comes out
- The person can breathe, speak, or cough effectively
- The person becomes unconscious (if this happens, call emergency services immediately and begin CPR if trained)

### Why Alternate?

- Different techniques may work for different types of obstructions
- Alternating increases the chances of dislodging the object
- Each technique uses different mechanisms (gravity + force vs. abdominal pressure)

## LESSON 7: SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS AND WHEN TO CALL FOR HELP

### Call Emergency Services If:

- The person becomes unconscious
- The obstruction cannot be cleared after several cycles
- You are alone and need help
- The person is pregnant, obese, or an infant (special techniques required)
- The person has difficulty breathing even after the object is removed

**Important**: If possible, have someone else call for emergency help while you continue to assist the choking person.

### If the Person Becomes Unconscious

- Lower them to the ground carefully
- Call emergency services immediately (or have someone else call)
- Begin CPR if you are trained (chest compressions can help dislodge the object)
- Check the mouth before giving rescue breaths and remove any visible objects

### After the Obstruction is Cleared

Even if the choking episode is resolved:

- Encourage the person to seek medical attention
- Abdominal thrusts can cause internal injuries that may not be immediately apparent
- Watch for signs of complications (difficulty breathing, abdominal pain, vomiting blood)

### Prevention Tips

To prevent choking:

✓ Cut food into small pieces, especially for children and elderly

✓ Chew food thoroughly before swallowing

✓ Avoid talking or laughing with food in your mouth

✓ Supervise young children during meals

✓ Keep small objects away from young children

✓ Avoid giving high-risk foods to young children (whole grapes, nuts, hard candy, popcorn)

✓ Eat slowly and mindfully

# MODULE SUMMARY

Choking can be a partial or complete airway obstruction. In partial obstruction, the patient can usually speak, cry, cough, or breathe—encourage them to keep coughing to clear the blockage and ask them to spit out the object if it's in their mouth. Do not put your fingers in their mouth. Start back blows if coughing doesn't work. In complete obstruction, the patient cannot speak, cough, or breathe and will become unconscious without help. Stand behind them, support their chest, lean them forward, and give up to 5 back blows between the shoulder blades using the heel of your hand. Check the mouth after each blow. If still choking, give 5 abdominal thrusts (Heimlich maneuver). Alternate between 5 back blows and 5 abdominal thrusts until the blockage is dislodged.

# KEY TAKEAWAYS

✓ Partial obstruction: Encourage coughing; person can still speak, cry, cough, or breathe.

✓ Complete obstruction: Person cannot speak, cough, or breathe—immediate action needed.

✓ Back blows: Stand behind, support chest, lean forward, give up to 5 blows between shoulder blades with heel of hand.

✓ Check mouth after each blow and remove visible objects.

✓ Abdominal thrusts (Heimlich): Give up to 5 thrusts if back blows don't work.

✓ Alternate: 5 back blows → 5 abdominal thrusts → repeat until blockage clears.

✓ Never put fingers in mouth during partial obstruction—they may bite accidentally.

✓ Call emergency services if a person becomes unconscious or obstruction cannot be cleared.
