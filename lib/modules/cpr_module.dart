# MODULE OVERVIEW

This module provides essential knowledge and guidelines for performing Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR), a life-saving technique used when someone's heart has stopped beating and they are not breathing. CPR combines chest compressions and rescue breaths to maintain blood circulation and oxygen supply to vital organs until professional medical help arrives.

# LEARNING OUTCOMES

By the end of this module, learners will be able to:

- Identify when CPR is necessary.
- Describe the correct technique for performing CPR.
- Demonstrate understanding of the proper compression-to-breath ratio.
- Explain the importance of calling for professional help before starting CPR.
- Understand how two-person CPR is performed.

## LESSON 1: WHEN IS CPR NECESSARY?

### Indications for CPR

CPR is necessary when a casualty meets BOTH of the following conditions:

✓ **Has no pulse** - The heart has stopped beating effectively.

✓ **Is not breathing** - The casualty is not taking breaths or only gasping.

### Critical Point

CPR should ONLY be performed when both conditions are present. If the person has a pulse but is not breathing, rescue breathing (not full CPR) may be appropriate instead.

## LESSON 2: BEFORE STARTING CPR

### Essential First Step: Call for Professional Help

Before beginning CPR, you must ensure that professional medical help has been called for.

**Actions to Take:**

- Call emergency services (911 or your local emergency number) immediately
- If others are present, designate someone specific to make the call
- If you are alone, make the call yourself before starting CPR (use speakerphone if possible)
- Provide clear information: location, condition of the victim, and that CPR is needed

**Remember**: Professional medical care is essential. CPR is a temporary measure to keep the victim alive until advanced medical help arrives.

## LESSON 3: THE CPR TECHNIQUE

### The 30:2 Ratio

CPR follows a specific pattern:

**30 Chest Compressions → 2 Rescue Breaths → Repeat**

### Chest Compressions

**Rate**: 100 compressions per minute

**Technique:**

- Position the casualty on a firm, flat surface
- Kneel beside the casualty's chest
- Place the heel of one hand on the center of the chest (on the lower half of the breastbone)
- Place your other hand on top and interlock your fingers
- Keep your arms straight and position your shoulders directly above your hands
- Push hard and fast, compressing the chest at least 2 inches (5 cm) deep for adults
- Allow the chest to fully recoil between compressions
- Count out loud to maintain rhythm and count

💡 **PRO TIP**: The best song to use for CPR timing is "Stayin' Alive" by Bee Gees! The beat of this song matches the recommended compression rate of 100 per minute. Singing or thinking of this song in your head can help you maintain the correct rhythm. How fitting that "Stayin' Alive" helps you keep someone alive!

### Rescue Breaths

After 30 compressions, give 2 rescue breaths:

- Tilt the casualty's head back gently to open the airway
- Pinch the nose closed
- Make a complete seal over the casualty's mouth with yours
- Give a breath lasting about 1 second
- Watch for the chest to rise
- Give a second breath
- Immediately return to chest compressions

**Important**: Each breath should be sufficient to make the chest visibly rise, but avoid excessive ventilation.

### Continue the Cycle

Repeat the cycle of 30 compressions and 2 breaths continuously until:

- Professional help arrives and takes over
- The casualty shows signs of life (starts breathing normally, moving, or regaining consciousness)
- You are physically unable to continue
- The scene becomes unsafe

## LESSON 4: TWO-PERSON CPR

### Advantages of Two-Person CPR

When two trained individuals are available, CPR can be more effective and less exhausting.

### How It Works

**Division of Tasks:**

- **Person 1**: Performs chest compressions
- **Person 2**: Gives rescue breaths

### Coordination

- Person 1 performs 30 chest compressions while counting out loud
- After the 30th compression, Person 1 pauses
- Person 2 immediately gives 2 rescue breaths
- Person 1 resumes compressions immediately after the second breath
- The cycle continues with minimal interruption

### Switching Roles

- Rescuers should switch roles every 2 minutes (or about 5 cycles) to prevent fatigue
- Switch quickly with minimal interruption to compressions
- The person giving breaths moves into position for compressions while the other prepares for breaths

### Benefits

✓ Less fatigue for each rescuer

✓ More consistent compression quality

✓ Shorter pauses between compressions and breaths

✓ Better overall effectiveness

## LESSON 5: KEY REMINDERS

### Quality CPR Checklist

✓ **Rate**: 100 compressions per minute (think "Stayin' Alive"!)

✓ **Depth**: At least 2 inches (5 cm) for adults

✓ **Recoil**: Allow full chest recoil between compressions

✓ **Ratio**: 30 compressions to 2 breaths

✓ **Minimize interruptions**: Keep pauses as short as possible

✓ **Call for help**: Ensure professional help is on the way

✓ **Continue**: Don't stop until help arrives or the victim recovers

### Safety Considerations

- Ensure the scene is safe before approaching
- Use personal protective equipment if available (CPR mask, gloves)
- If you are unwilling or unable to give rescue breaths, perform hands-only CPR (continuous chest compressions)
- Do not stop to check for pulse frequently—continue CPR cycles

# MODULE SUMMARY

CPR is a critical life-saving skill that can mean the difference between life and death. It is performed when a casualty has no pulse and is not breathing. The technique involves cycles of 30 chest compressions at a rate of 100 per minute (the tempo of "Stayin' Alive" by Bee Gees), followed by 2 rescue breaths. Always ensure professional help has been called before starting CPR. When two people are available, one can perform compressions while the other gives breaths, making the process more efficient and less tiring.

# KEY TAKEAWAYS

✓ CPR is necessary when there is no pulse and no breathing.

✓ Always call for professional help before starting CPR.

✓ Follow the 30:2 ratio - 30 compressions, then 2 breaths.

✓ Perform compressions at a rate of 100 per minute (use "Stayin' Alive" as your rhythm guide!).

✓ Two-person CPR divides tasks: one does compressions, the other gives breaths.

✓ Continue CPR until help arrives or the victim shows signs of life.
