# MODULE OVERVIEW

This module provides comprehensive guidance on the proper cleaning and management of wounds, both open and closed. Understanding how to properly care for wounds is essential to prevent infection, promote healing, and minimize complications. This module covers step-by-step interventions for different types of wounds and teaches learners to recognize when professional medical attention is needed.

# LEARNING OUTCOMES

By the end of this module, learners will be able to:

- Differentiate between open and closed wounds.
- Demonstrate proper hand hygiene before wound care.
- Apply correct techniques for cleaning and treating open wounds.
- Identify appropriate interventions for closed wounds.
- Recognize signs of infection requiring medical attention.
- Understand when a tetanus shot is necessary.

## LESSON 1: UNDERSTANDING WOUNDS

### What is a Wound?

A wound is any damage or break in the surface of the skin or underlying tissues. Wounds can be classified into two main categories:

### Open Wounds

Open wounds are any internal or external injury that leaves internal tissues exposed to the external environment.

**Examples:**

- Cuts and lacerations
- Scrapes and abrasions
- Puncture wounds
- Surgical incisions

**Key Concern**: Open wounds are at higher risk for infection because internal tissues are exposed to bacteria and contaminants.

### Closed Wounds

Closed wounds are injuries where the skin remains intact, but underlying tissues are damaged.

**Common Causes:**

- Direct blunt trauma
- Falls
- Vehicle accidents
- Sports injuries

**Examples:**

- Bruises (contusions)
- Hematomas (blood collection under skin)
- Crush injuries

**Key Concern**: While the skin is not broken, internal damage can still be significant and may require medical attention.

## LESSON 2: TREATING OPEN WOUNDS

### Step-by-Step Intervention for Open Wounds

### Step 1: Wash Your Hands

**Why it's important**: Hand washing is the single most important step to avoid introducing infection into the wound.

**How to do it:**

- Use soap and clean water
- Wash for at least 20 seconds
- Dry with a clean towel
- If soap and water aren't available, use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol

**Remember**: Always wash your hands BEFORE touching the wound or any wound care supplies.

### Step 2: Stop the Bleeding

**For Minor Cuts and Scrapes:**

- Most minor wounds stop bleeding on their own
- If bleeding continues, apply gentle pressure with a clean bandage or cloth
- Elevate the wound above heart level if possible
- Maintain pressure until bleeding stops

**Important**: Do not remove the cloth if blood soaks through—add more layers on top and continue pressure.

### Step 3: Clean the Wound

**Proper Cleaning Technique:**

- **Rinse with water**: Hold the wound under running tap water. This is the most effective way to reduce the risk of infection.

- **Wash around the wound**: Use soap to clean the skin AROUND the wound, but don't get soap directly IN the wound, as this can cause irritation.

- **Remove debris:**
  - Clean tweezers with rubbing alcohol
  - Gently remove any visible dirt or debris
  - If debris is embedded deeply or you cannot remove all of it, see a doctor for help

**What NOT to do:**

- Don't use hydrogen peroxide or iodine directly in the wound (can damage tissue)
- Don't scrub the wound vigorously
- Don't use cotton balls that can leave fibers in the wound

### Step 4: Apply Antibiotic Ointment or Petroleum Jelly

**Purpose**: Keeps the wound surface moist, which promotes healing and prevents scarring.

**How to apply:**

- Use only a thin layer
- Common options: antibiotic ointment (like Neosporin) or petroleum jelly (like Vaseline)
- Apply gently without rubbing

**Important Note**: If a rash appears after application, stop using the ointment. Some people are sensitive to certain ingredients that can cause mild allergic reactions.

### Step 5: Cover the Wound

**When to cover:**

- Cover wounds that are likely to get dirty
- Cover wounds that may rub against clothing
- Leave minor scratches uncovered if they're clean and unlikely to be contaminated

**How to cover:**

- Use an adhesive bandage for small wounds
- Use rolled gauze or gauze pads held with paper tape for larger wounds
- Ensure the covering is clean and sterile
- Don't wrap too tightly—allow for circulation

**Benefits of covering:**

- Keeps the wound clean
- Protects from bacteria
- Prevents further injury
- Keeps the wound moist for better healing

### Step 6: Change the Dressing

**Frequency**: At least once a day OR whenever the bandage becomes:

- Wet
- Dirty
- Loose or falling off

**How to change:**

- Wash your hands first
- Gently remove the old bandage
- Clean the wound again if needed
- Check for signs of healing or infection
- Apply fresh ointment
- Apply a new, clean bandage

### Step 7: Get a Tetanus Shot (If Needed)

**When a tetanus shot is recommended:**

- You haven't had a tetanus shot in the past 5 years
- AND the wound is deep

**Why it's important**: Tetanus is a serious bacterial infection that can enter through wounds. The bacteria produce toxins that affect the nervous system and can be life-threatening.

**Action**: Contact your doctor or visit an urgent care clinic to receive a tetanus booster if needed.

### Step 8: Watch for Signs of Infection

**Signs of infection include:**

- Redness spreading from the wound
- Increasing pain (pain that gets worse instead of better)
- Drainage (pus or cloudy fluid)
- Warmth around the wound area
- Swelling that increases over time
- Fever or feeling unwell
- Red streaks extending from the wound

**Action**: If you notice ANY of these signs, see a doctor immediately. Infections can become serious quickly if left untreated.

## LESSON 3: TREATING CLOSED WOUNDS

### Interventions for Closed Wounds

Closed wounds require different care since the skin is not broken. The focus is on reducing swelling, pain, and preventing further damage.

### R.I.C.E. Method Plus Immobilization

### 1. Ice Packs

- Apply ice wrapped in a cloth (never directly on skin)
- Use for 15-20 minutes at a time
- Repeat every 2-3 hours for the first 48 hours
- Reduces swelling and numbs pain

### 2. Compression

- Use an elastic bandage to wrap the injured area
- Wrap snugly but not too tight (you should be able to slip a finger under)
- Reduces swelling and provides support
- Remove if numbness, tingling, or increased pain occurs

### 3. Elevation

- Raise the injured area above heart level when possible
- Use pillows for support
- Helps reduce swelling by allowing fluid to drain

### 4. Immobilization

- Limit movement of the injured area
- Use splints or slings if appropriate
- Prevents further injury
- Allows healing to begin

### Watch for Signs of Infection or Complications

Even with closed wounds, watch for:

- Redness on the skin near the injury
- Increasing pain
- Warmth
- Swelling that doesn't improve or gets worse
- Drainage (which would indicate the wound has opened)

**Action**: If any of these signs appear, see a doctor immediately.

### When to Seek Medical Attention for Closed Wounds

See a doctor if:

- Pain is severe or doesn't improve
- You cannot move the injured area
- You suspect a fracture or broken bone
- The injured area looks deformed
- Swelling is severe
- Numbness or tingling develops

## LESSON 4: INFECTION PREVENTION AND RECOGNITION

### Why Infection Prevention Matters

Infections can:

- Delay healing
- Cause serious complications
- Lead to systemic illness
- Result in permanent damage or scarring
- In severe cases, become life-threatening

### Key Prevention Strategies

✓ Hand hygiene before and after wound care

✓ Proper cleaning of the wound

✓ Keeping the wound moist with ointment

✓ Covering the wound to protect from contamination

✓ Changing dressings regularly

✓ Monitoring for signs of infection

### Recognizing Infection: The 5 Cardinal Signs

Remember these five signs of infection:

1. **Redness** (Rubor)
2. **Heat/Warmth** (Calor)
3. **Swelling** (Tumor)
4. **Pain** (Dolor)
5. **Loss of function** (Functio laesa)

If you observe these signs increasing rather than decreasing over time, seek medical attention.

## LESSON 5: SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS

### When to See a Doctor Immediately

Seek professional medical care if:

- The wound is deep or gaping
- Bleeding doesn't stop after 10 minutes of pressure
- The wound is from an animal or human bite
- The wound is contaminated with dirt, debris, or foreign objects you cannot remove
- The wound is on the face, hand, or joint
- You see signs of infection
- The wound was caused by a rusty or dirty object
- You haven't had a tetanus shot in 5+ years (for deep wounds)
- You have diabetes or a weakened immune system

### Wounds That Require Professional Care

- Deep cuts that may need stitches
- Puncture wounds (especially from nails, needles, or animal bites)
- Wounds with jagged edges that won't close on their own
- Wounds that won't stop bleeding
- Wounds showing signs of infection
- Wounds over joints that open when the joint moves

# MODULE SUMMARY

Proper wound care is essential for preventing infection and promoting healing. Open wounds require thorough cleaning with running water, removal of debris, application of antibiotic ointment or petroleum jelly, and covering with a clean bandage. Always wash your hands first to prevent infection. Change dressings at least daily and watch for signs of infection such as redness, warmth, swelling, increasing pain, or drainage. Closed wounds are treated with ice packs, compression, elevation, and immobilization. A tetanus shot is recommended for deep wounds if you haven't had one in the past 5 years. When in doubt, seek professional medical attention.

# KEY TAKEAWAYS

✓ Always wash your hands before treating any wound.

✓ Open wounds need cleaning with running water, debris removal, ointment, and covering.

✓ Closed wounds are treated with ice, compression, elevation, and immobilization.

✓ Change dressings at least once daily or when wet/dirty.

✓ Watch for infection signs: redness, warmth, swelling, pain, drainage.

✓ Tetanus shot needed if 5+ years since last shot and wound is deep.

✓ Seek medical help for deep wounds, uncontrolled bleeding, or signs of infection.
