# MODULE OVERVIEW

This module provides essential guidance on the proper first aid and medical management of animal bites, including bites from dogs, snakes, and potentially rabid animals. Animal bites can lead to serious complications such as infection, rabies, or envenomation, making prompt and appropriate care critical.

# LEARNING OUTCOMES

By the end of this module, learners will be able to:

- Describe the proper first aid steps for treating animal bites.
- Explain the special considerations for snake bites.
- Understand when rabies shots and tetanus shots are necessary.
- Recognize signs of infection and when to seek medical help.
- Understand the importance of completing prescribed antibiotic courses.

## LESSON 1: UNDERSTANDING ANIMAL BITES

### Types of Animal Bites

Animal bites can come from various sources:

**Domestic Animals:**

- Dogs
- Cats
- Rodents (hamsters, rats, etc.)

**Wild Animals:**

- Bats
- Raccoons
- Foxes
- Skunks
- Snakes

**Rabid Animals:**

- Any mammal that may carry the rabies virus

### Risks Associated with Animal Bites

**1. Infection**

- Animal mouths contain bacteria that can cause serious infections
- Puncture wounds are especially prone to infection

**2. Rabies**

- A deadly viral disease transmitted through saliva
- Can be prevented with prompt vaccination after exposure

**3. Envenomation (Snake Bites)**

- Venom can cause tissue damage, bleeding disorders, or systemic effects
- Requires immediate medical attention

**4. Tetanus**

- Bacterial infection that can enter through wounds
- Preventable with vaccination

## LESSON 2: FIRST AID FOR GENERAL ANIMAL BITES (DOGS, CATS, ETC.)

### Step 1: Wash the Bitten Area Thoroughly

**What to do:**

- Wash the wound immediately with soap and water
- Rinse thoroughly under running water for several minutes
- This is the single most important step to prevent infection

**Why it's important:**

- Removes bacteria and contaminants from the wound
- Reduces the risk of infection significantly

### Step 2: Apply Antibiotic Cream

**What to do:**

- After cleaning and drying the wound, apply a thin layer of antibiotic cream or ointment

**Why it's important:**

- Provides additional protection against infection
- Keeps the wound moist for better healing

### Step 3: Cover the Wound

**What to do:**

- Cover the bite with a clean bandage or sterile dressing

**Why it's important:**

- Protects the wound from dirt and bacteria
- Prevents further contamination

### Step 4: Observe for Signs of Infection

**What to watch for:**

- Redness spreading from the wound
- Increased warmth around the area
- Swelling
- Pus or drainage
- Increased pain
- Fever
- Red streaks extending from the wound

**Action**: If any signs of infection appear, seek medical attention immediately.

### Step 5: Do Not Scratch or Rub the Wound

**Why it's important:**

- Scratching can introduce new bacteria
- Can damage healing tissue
- May worsen infection
- Can increase scarring

**Tip**: If itching occurs during healing, this is normal, but resist the urge to scratch.

## LESSON 3: RABIES PREVENTION

### When Rabies is a Concern

Rabies risk is higher with:

- Bites from wild animals (bats, raccoons, foxes, skunks)
- Bites from stray or unknown dogs or cats
- Animals acting strangely or aggressively
- Any animal that cannot be observed for signs of rabies

### Rabies Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP)

**What it is:**

- A series of shots given over the next few weeks after a bite that puts you at risk for rabies

**How it works:**

- Prevents the rabies virus from causing disease
- Must be started as soon as possible after exposure
- Highly effective when given promptly

**Important:**

- You MUST complete the full cycle of shots
- Do not skip appointments
- Follow the doctor's instructions exactly
- Rabies is almost always fatal once symptoms appear, but preventable with proper vaccination

**The doctor will tell you:**

- When to get each shot
- How many shots you need
- What to watch for

## LESSON 4: SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR SNAKE BITES

### Critical Difference: Do NOT Wash Snake Bites

**Why:**

- Traces of venom left on the skin can help medical personnel identify the type of snake
- Identification helps determine the appropriate antivenom treatment

### Immediate Actions for Snake Bites

**1. Seek Medical Help Immediately**

- Call emergency services or get to a hospital as fast as possible
- Snake bites are medical emergencies

**2. Use Pressure Immobilization Bandage**

- Apply a firm bandage over the bite site
- Wrap the entire limb (like wrapping a sprained ankle)
- The bandage should be firm but not cut off circulation
- This slows the spread of venom through the lymphatic system

**3. Splint the Limb**

- Keep the bitten limb still and immobilized
- Use a splint or any rigid object to prevent movement
- Movement can spread venom faster

**4. Keep the Person Calm and Still**

- Physical activity increases venom spread
- Have the person lie down if possible
- Keep the bitten area at or below heart level

### Special Case: Snake Bite on the Torso

**Important Consideration:**

- If the bite is on the torso (chest, abdomen, back), bandaging is still recommended
- Make sure the bandaging does not restrict breathing
- Monitor the person's breathing continuously
- Loosen bandages if breathing becomes difficult

### What NOT to Do for Snake Bites

❌ Do NOT wash the bite area

❌ Do NOT cut the wound

❌ Do NOT try to suck out the venom

❌ Do NOT apply ice

❌ Do NOT apply a tourniquet

❌ Do NOT give the person food, drink, or medication unless directed by medical personnel

## LESSON 5: TETANUS PREVENTION

### What is Tetanus?

Tetanus is a serious bacterial infection that affects the nervous system and causes painful muscle contractions, particularly in the jaw and neck.

### When a Tetanus Shot is Needed

You may need a tetanus shot if:

- You have not received one in the last 5 years
- The wound is deep or dirty
- The bite is from an animal

**Action:**

- Inform your doctor of your vaccination history
- Get a tetanus booster if recommended
- Keep a record of your tetanus vaccinations

## LESSON 6: PAIN MANAGEMENT AND ANTIBIOTICS

### Pain Management

**What to do:**

- Ask the doctor if you can take over-the-counter pain relievers to ease the pain
- Common options: acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin)

**Important:**

- Always consult with a doctor before taking pain medication
- Follow dosage instructions
- Some medications may interact with other treatments

### Antibiotic Treatment

**If prescribed antibiotics:**

**Critical Rules:**

- **Take them at the given time**
  - Set reminders if needed
  - Take with or without food as directed

- **Complete the full course**
  - Do NOT stop taking antibiotics even if you feel better
  - Stopping early can lead to antibiotic resistance
  - Infection may return stronger

- **Follow all instructions**
  - Take the exact dose prescribed
  - Don't skip doses
  - Don't share antibiotics with others

**Why it matters:**

- Ensures complete elimination of bacteria
- Prevents complications
- Reduces risk of antibiotic-resistant infections

## LESSON 7: WHEN TO SEEK MEDICAL ATTENTION

### Seek Immediate Medical Help If:

- The bite is from a wild animal or unknown animal
- The bite is deep or large
- Bleeding cannot be controlled
- The bite is on the face, neck, hands, or genitals
- The bite is from a snake
- You suspect rabies exposure
- Signs of infection develop
- You have not had a tetanus shot in 5+ years
- The animal was acting strangely or aggressively

### Follow-Up Care

**Return to the doctor if:**

- Infection signs appear or worsen
- The wound doesn't heal properly
- You develop fever
- Pain increases instead of decreasing
- You have concerns about your recovery

# MODULE SUMMARY

Animal bites require prompt and proper care to prevent serious complications. For most animal bites (dogs, cats, etc.), wash the area thoroughly with soap and water, apply antibiotic cream, cover with a clean bandage, and observe for signs of infection. Never scratch or rub the wound. If at risk for rabies, get a series of shots and complete the full cycle as instructed by your doctor. Snake bites are different—do NOT wash the skin (venom traces help identify the snake), seek medical help immediately, use a pressure immobilization bandage, and splint the limb. For torso bites, ensure bandaging doesn't restrict breathing. A tetanus shot may be needed if you haven't had one in 5 years. Ask your doctor about pain relievers, and if antibiotics are prescribed, take them at the given time and complete the full course.

# KEY TAKEAWAYS
